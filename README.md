## To-do
* Do the 2nd sentence of the optional part in [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
  * (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. <strong>Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.</strong>
