## Insights
* <strong>April 07, 2020</strong>
  * I made the repo for this project 2 days earlier, April 5. I started working on it yesterday(April 6) afternoon, and I finished it just now. I didn't have much trouble finishing this project, or maybe that's just my brain telling me it was easy because I finished it. Maybe because I'm now comfortable in manipulating DOM elements. Nonetheless, this was a good project to exercise my DOM manipulation skills.
  
## To-do
* Do the 2nd sentence of the optional part in [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
  * (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. <strong>Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.</strong>
